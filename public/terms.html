you of any changes. Modifications to this Agreement shall be effective
after posting.</p>
<p><em><strong>To Services</strong></em></p>
<p>Company reserves the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, the Company Services (or any part thereof) with or without
notice. You agree that the Company shall not be liable to you or to any
third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the
Company Services.</p>
<p><strong>DISPUTES</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Between Users</strong></em></p>
<p>If there is a dispute between users of the Sites, or between users
and any third party, you understand and agree that the Company is under
no obligation to become involved. If you have a dispute with one or more
other users, you release Company, its officers, employees, agents and
successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and
consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and
unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way
related to such disputes and/or the Company Services.</p>
<p><em><strong>With Company</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong> This Agreement and
all aspects of the Sites and Company Services shall be governed by and
construed under the internal laws of the State of Florida without regard
to conflict of law provisions. Regarding any disputes or claims not
subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth
below), you agree not to begin or prosecute any action in connection
therewith other than in the state and federal courts in United States
County, State of Florida, and you consent to, and waive all defences of
lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens regarding, venue
and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Application of the Uniform
Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from this
agreement. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you
related to the Sites or Company Services be instituted over two (2)
years after the cause of action arose.</p>
<p><strong>B. Informal Resolution.</strong> To expedite resolution and
control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this
Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Company agree to first attempt to
negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes below) informally for at
least 14 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.
Such informal negotiations begin upon written notice from one person to
the other.</p>
<p><strong>C. Binding Arbitration.</strong> If you and the company
cannot resolve a Dispute about informal negotiations, either you or the
company may elect to have the Dispute (except those disputes excluded
below) finally and only resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to
arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE
IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be begun and
conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer
Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The
determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather
than an arbitrator. The AAA Consumer Rules shall govern your arbitration
fees and your share of arbitrator compensation and, where appropriate,
limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the
arbitrator to be excessive, the company will pay all arbitration fees
and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will decide
in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested
by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may
be challenged if the arbitrator cannot do so. Except where otherwise
required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration
will take place in United States County, the State of Florida. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in
court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
confirm, change, vacate or enter judgement on the award entered by the
arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>D. Restrictions.</strong> You and Company agree that any
arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Company and you
individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration
shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for
any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to use class
action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any
Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
of the public or any other persons.</p>
<p><strong>E. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and
Arbitration.</strong> You and Company agree that the following disputes
are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect,
or concerning the validity of your or the company’s intellectual
property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use;
and (3) any claim for injunctive relief. If this Section is illegal or
unenforceable, then neither you nor Company will elect to arbitrate any
Dispute falling within that portion of this Section found to be illegal
or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction over,
and you and the company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
that court.</p>
